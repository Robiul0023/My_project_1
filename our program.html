			but has within the last two decades become closely associated with human resources management, 
			talent management, human resources development, 
			instructional design, human factors, and knowledge managementBetter training deliver better feedback.</p>

			<h2>Establish community school.</h2>
			<img src="img-1/school.jpg" alt="food-training center" />
			<h4>What is a Community School?</h4>
			<p>A community school is both a place and a set of partnerships between the school and other community resources. Its integrated focus on academics, health and social services, youth and community development and community engagement leads to improved student learning, stronger families and healthier communities. Community schools offer a personalized curriculum that emphasizes real-world learning and community problem-solving. Schools become centers of the community and are open to everyone – all day, every day, evenings and weekends.

				Using public schools as hubs, community schools bring together many partners to offer a range of supports and opportunities to children, youth, families and communities. Partners work to achieve these results: Children are ready to enter school; students attend school consistently; 
				students are actively involved in learning and their community; 
				families are increasingly involved with their children's education; 
				schools are engaged with families and communities; 
				students succeed academically;

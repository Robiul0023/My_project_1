	undoubtedly true that animal and bird is the main source of human food meat and it is also universal true that some bird and animal keep 
	much contribution to remove air pollution.</p>
	<p>bird, (class Aves), any of the more than 10,400 living species unique in having feathers, 
	the major characteristic that distinguishes them from all other animals. 
	A more-elaborate definition would note that they are warm-blooded vertebrates more related to reptiles than to mammals and that they have a four-chambered heart (as do mammals),
	forelimbs modified into wings (a trait shared with bats), a hard-shelled egg, and keen vision, the major sense they rely on for information about the environment.

  <p>water pollution, the release of substances into subsurface groundwater or into lakes, 
  streams, rivers, estuaries, and oceans to the point where the substances interfere with beneficial use of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems. 
  In addition to the release of substances, 
  such as chemicals or microorganisms, water pollution may also include the release of energy,
  in the form of radioactivity or heat, into bodies of water.</p>
  <h2>Sewage and other water pollutants.</h2>

<p>Water bodies can be polluted by a wide variety of substances, 
including pathogenic microorganisms, putrescible organic waste, plant nutrients, toxic chemicals, sediments, heat, petroleum (oil), and radioactive substances. Several types of water pollutants are considered below. 
(For a discussion of the handling of sewage and other forms of waste produced by human activities, see waste disposal.)</p>

  <p>Air is the main source of oxygen. Which is essential part of human  being existency in the earth. Without air our human 
  in the earth is quite impossible.</p>
  <p>Air pollution can damage crops and trees in a variety of ways. 
  Ground-level ozone can lead to reductions in agricultural crop and commercial forest yields,
  reduced growth and survivability of tree seedlings, and increased plant susceptibility to disease, 
  pests and other environmental stresses (such as harsh weather).</p>
  <h2>Environmental and Health Impacts of Air Pollution</h2>
  <p>One of our era's greatest scourges is air pollution, 
  on account not only of its impact on climate change but also its impact on public and individual health due to increasing morbidity and mortality. 
  There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans. 
  Among them, Particulate Matter (PM), particles of variable but very small diameter, 
  penetrate the respiratory system via inhalation, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,
  reproductive and central nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer.
